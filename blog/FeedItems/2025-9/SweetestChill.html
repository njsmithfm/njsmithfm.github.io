            The The mainly, but also a bunch of German post-krautrock stuff. Nena and Rio Reiser. Around this time last year, I was on a train to Berlin, where I'd bike around for a couple days on a German-made belt-drive bicycle which was probably the smoothest I've ever ridden. Anyway in my more localized jukebox travels this week I found a photo I hadn’t seen before of 6 legends from that era, but I only knew half of them, Debbie Harry and Siouxsie Sioux and Pauline Black. I got called blondie here and there until my teenage years because I had bright platinum hair. And as fate would have it in my 20s I ultimately ended up with my own vinyl copy of Eat to the Beat and I loved it. I knew “Atomic” already but they got me with “Die Young Stay Pretty.” Blondie went ska!<br/>

            <p>Which is where we now arrive. I love 2-Tone, and I've been fortunate to see a handful of these groups live. 
            Fishbone's not 2-Tone but Pauline Black's a firm influence on Angelo Moore and he's gone on record saying so. As a group they are challenging but I have been glad to have seen them twice now. The first time was in Montclair when they tourned with Parliament-Funkadelic and I got to meet Angelo after the show. 
            One of the first shows I saw after moving to New York was The Beat at Le Poisson Rouge. Dave Wakeling is not </p>
