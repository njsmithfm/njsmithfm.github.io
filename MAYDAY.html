            production editor from January 2022 through February 2023, just a
            bit over a year.
          </p>

          <p class="about-text-list-items" style="margin-top: 1.5rem">
            While there, I published all the magazine's content to web, across
            genres including fiction, nonfiction, poetry, cultural commentary,
            criticism, etc. I was on the managing editorial team, which set
            the quarterly publishing schedule, and I had ownership of the
            magazine's WordPress CMS and all digital assets. 
          </p>

<p class="about-text-list-items" style="margin-top: 1.5rem">
  While at MAYDAY I produced some digital contests: 
  <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-left: 1rem;">
    <li>Our poetry editors held a micro-chapbook contest, and I worked directly with the winning author to <a href="https://maydaymagazine.com/this-body-i-have-tried-to-write-by-janet-danielo/" target="_blank">format the chapbook for web and host it online</a>, and I contributed to the cover design too. (pictured right)
    <li>There was a "March Madness" inspired flash-fiction competition which was held on our social presence across 4 weeks, in which fiction pieces went head-to-head and our readers voted on them in a bracket until one remained. </li>
    </li>
  </ul>

          <p style="margin-top: 1rem">Being a web-only literary publisher, I often had to custom style some of the material (typically poetry) with HTML and CSS to preserve its form. More broadly, I also optimized the magazine's style guide, streamlined backend CMS practices, and brought SEO into their editorial process for all content. </p>
