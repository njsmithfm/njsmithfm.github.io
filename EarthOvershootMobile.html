          "Earth Overshoot Day" is a joint initiative by the Global Footprint
          Network, York University, and Footprint Data Foundation. It addresses
          the question of
          <i
            >"how do we model patterns of behavior, country by country, for
            renewable resources?"</i
          >

          The key insight the research offers is the concept of "Overshoot Day,"
          which is a calculation of the date in each calendar year in which the
          demand for renewable resources surpasses Earth's ability to renew
          those resources, within the year.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem">
          "Overshoot Day" is the date each year on which our consumption of
          resources surpasses Earth's generative budget for that year.
        </h3>

        <p>
          The data published through this research's
          <a

          >
          yields several interesting metrics, both for planet Earth as well as
          individual countries. For example, let us explore the following
          map--it indicates, country by country, the amount of Earths it would
          take to meet the consumption demands on natural resources if everyone
          across the planet consumed resources as the country in question does.
          The United States requires 4.9 Earths, which means that if all
          countries consumed resources at the rate that Americans do, it would
          require 4.9 Earths to meet the demand within a calendar year.

              demand did not surpass Earth's ability to generate resources,
              which means they had no Overshoot Day for 2024 and they are not

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">Here is Earth's biocapacity measured from 1961 up to 2024.</p>
          <p>
              Biocapacity is made up of different types of land or
              water, measured in global hectares which are "biologically
              productive hectare[s] with world-average productivity." Footprint
              Network divides this into

                >5 categories of productive renewable area</a
              >: Grazing Land, Forest Products, Fishing Grounds, Cropland, and
              Built-Up Land, which together yield the Earth's total biocapacity.
              Here, we see each of these area types gradually decreasing each
              year since Footprint Network began tracking the data, in 1961. The
              area chart below shows Earth's resoureces in hectares available on
              a per-person basis, in constant decline over the past several
              decades.

              Those in <strong id="red">red</strong> consumed most
              (Qatar, Luxembourg for example) while those in
              <strong id="green" green">green</strong> consumed the least, or

              Earth Overshoot Day is a useful metric, offering a paradigm which
              centers us in relationship with Earth's material budget. By
              placing us in a measurable position on the calendar, and with
              insights country-by-country down to the individual level, it
              closes the gap between a subject and their surroundings. "The
              environment" is no longer separated from the individual.

              This point of view encourages us to think about resource
              consumption in terms of regenerative capacity, and highlights the
              urgent need for systemic changes in how we produce, consume, and
              manage resources globally, while placing each of us within the
              effort.

        <h2>What Can We Do?</h2>
        <p>
          Some of The Footprint Network's proposed solutions range from personal
          changes such as reduced meat consumption, car travel, and energy use,
          to larger policy shifts like prioritizing renewable energy, land
          protections, and economic reform. Through any and all actions, the
          goal is to move the goalpost and push the Overshoot Date to earlier in
          the calendar year.
