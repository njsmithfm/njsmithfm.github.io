          "Earth Overshoot Day" is a joint initiative by the Global Footprint
          Network, York University, and Footprint Data Foundation. It addresses
          the question of
          <i
            >"how do we model patterns of behavior, country by country, for
            renewable resources?"</i
          >

          The key insight the research offers is the concept of "Overshoot Day,"
          which is a calculation of the date in each calendar year in which the
          demand for renewable resources surpasses Earth's ability to renew
          those resources, within the year.
        </p>


        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem">
          "Overshoot Day" is the date each year on which our consumption of
          resources surpasses Earth's generative budget for that year.
        </h3>

        <p>
          The data published through this research's

          yields several interesting metrics, both for planet Earth as well as
          individual countries. In the graphs that follow, we'll examine them.

          <p style="font-weight: bold;"> For example, explore this map--it indicates, country by country,
            the amount of Earths it would take to meet the consumption demands
            on renewable resources, if everyone globally followed that
            country's consumption patterns.</p>
            <p>
              Tap the United States. If everyone on Earth consumed like
              Americans do, it would take 4.9 Earths to generate enough
              renewable resources to meet that rate of demand within a year.

          <p>A key term to introduce here is <strong style="font-weight: bold;">Ecological Footprint</strong>, which is a measure of "how much nature we have and how much nature we use."<br /><br />
            Some countries have ecological <strong style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">deficits</strong>, while others have
            <strong style="font-weight: bold; color: green;">reserves</strong>. <br /><br />
            If a country's ecological footprint exceeds its biocapacity, that region runs a biocapacity deficit.<br><br>
            Conversely, if the regional biocapacity exceeds the population's footprint, it has a biocapacity reserve.<br /><br />

            As you can see in the scatterplot, most countries fall slightly below zero, indicating a deficit.

            <p>
              This scatterplot also distributes countries along the months of the year to indicate each's
              Overshoot Day for 2024, whereas their ecological deficit or reserve is shown on the y-axis. <br /><br />

              (Some countries' ecological demand did not surpass Earth's ability
              to generate resources, which means they had no Overshoot Day for
              2024, thus they are not plotted here)

              Notice the unit of measurement on the y-axis:  <a

              Earth is covered in different types of land and water, which
              Footprint Network measures in global hectares (gba).
             <br /><br />

              One hectare is 10,000 square meters, or roughly 2.47 acres.
              Global hectares are defined as "biologically productive hectare[s]
              with world-average productivity."

            >: Grazing Land, Forest Products, Fishing Grounds, Cropland, and
            Built-Up Land, which together yield the Earth's total biocapacity.</p>
            <p>
            In the area chart here, we see each of these area types gradually
            decreasing each year since Footprint Network began tracking the
            data, in 1961.

            By using Global Hectares per Person as its metric, and by asking us to imagine everyone globally following different countries' consumption patterns to render these measurements, Earth Overshoot Day offers a lens which
            centers each of us in relationship with Earth's material budget.</p></div>

              Notice two countries in <strong style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">red</strong>--Luxembourg and Qatar. Their demand for resources far exceeds their biocapacity. Now, see how those small countries now become some of the largest on the map!

        <h2>Overshoot Day As Paradigm
        </h2>
        <p>
        
          By placing us in a measurable position on the calendar, and with insights country-by-country down to the individual level, it closes the gap between a subject and their surroundings.
          
          This point of view encourages us to think about resource consumption in terms of regenerative capacity, and highlights the urgent need for systemic changes in how we produce, consume, and manage resources globally, while placing each of us within the effort. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Some of The Footprint Network's proposed solutions range from personal
          changes such as reduced meat consumption, car travel, and energy use,
          to larger policy shifts like prioritizing renewable energy, land
          protections, and economic reform. Through any and all actions, the
          goal is to move the goalpost and push the Overshoot Date to earlier in
          the calendar year.
