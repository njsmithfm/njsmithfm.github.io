          <h1>Operability of ADA-Accessible MTA Stations</h1>

          <p class="about-text-list-items" style="margin-top: 1.5rem">
            I have mobility-limited family members, and have had to think
            through ways for us to get around if they were to visit me in NYC. I
            started looking into the MTA's accessible stations, and found that
            while Manhattan has the most ADA-approved stations in sheer volume,
            Brooklyn's ADA stations are most often to be in full working
            condition. Granted, all boroughs perform fairly well in this metric
            (above 90%), but it is nice to see the systems improving.
          </p>
