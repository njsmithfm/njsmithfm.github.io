            <i>Link Outage</i> is an in-development 3-channel immersive motion
            graphics piece which started in an After Effects class I took at
            Parsons, under the guidance of new media artist Eva Davidova. I
            later adapted it to TouchDesigner, for optimized generative graphics
            through built-in Python scripting.

            The project is based on a period of time when both my parents were
            separately hospitalized, after each suffered significant bodily
            trauma, and in different parts of the country.


            From their hospital beds, each one called me (I live far away in New
            York), and left me voicemails about what they'd been through. My
            phone transcribed these mp3 messages with some minor errors, and I
            took the idea of digital communications about something highly
            physical and bodily as my starting point. I chose to center the
            audience in my point of view, as the distanced son receiving all
            this information through a phone which somewhat compromises their
            words.
 
            Across the different screens, their words float around the viewer,
            with the typos preserved, against a background of visual noise.
            Their voices each follow their visualized representations,
            encircling the audience across 3 separate monitors to provoke a
            sensation of disoriented sympathy while this audio-visual
            information swirls around.
